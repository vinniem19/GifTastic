This is a Giphy API pull project.

The page loads with four simple buttons corresponding to four random seasons in the year.

The user has an option to add the name of a season in the text input; this will add a button with the name of that season to the displayed buttons

A user can click on each of the buttons, and ten images will be populated below the buttons. The images are Giphy images that relate to the season pressed.

These can be paused when one clicks on them and unpaused with another click.
